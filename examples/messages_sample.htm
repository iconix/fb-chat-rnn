ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

Lewis Carroll

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0




CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
conversation?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it.

'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do
bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and
see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a
telescope.'

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said
Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *




CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears

'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must
go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending
presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
       HEARTHRUG,
         NEAR THE FENDER,
           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like
you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this
moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
see if she could have been changed for any of them.

'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her
hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
same as they used to do:--

     'How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!'

'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
of being all alone here!'

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must
be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high.

'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day.'

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she
began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'

'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
YOU like cats if you were me?'

'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not.'

'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'

'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--"'

'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.

'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did
you speak?'

'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.

'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'

'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.

'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
"it" means.'

'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?'

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
to Alice as it spoke.

'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
dry me at all.'

'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--'

'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'

'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'

'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.

'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
a-piece all round.

'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.

'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.

'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.

'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
something like this:--

         'Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     "Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.--Come,
           I'll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I've
    nothing
    to do."
     Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, "Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath."
       "I'll be
        judge, I'll
         be jury,"
            Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          "I'll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death."'


'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you
thinking of?'

'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?'

'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking
away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'

'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,
you know!'

The Mouse only growled in reply.

'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the
others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'

'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'

'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
had made.

'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that!'

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't
drunk quite so much!'

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful
tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'

'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'

'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!'

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll
go round and get in at the window.'

'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!'

'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)

'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'

'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')

'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!'

'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'

'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of
cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em
together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll
do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney!'

'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I THINK I can kick a little!'

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'
then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!'

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought
Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'

'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.

'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'

'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'
she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'
which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose.'

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
the best plan.'

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?'

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.




CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.

'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.'

'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
yourself!'

'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
myself, you see.'

'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.

'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.'

'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you?'

'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.'

'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'

'Why?' said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
to say!'

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.

'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

'No,' said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
you're changed, do you?'

'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'

'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:--

   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
    'And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'

   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
    'I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'

   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    'I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
    Allow me to sell you a couple?'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
    Pray how did you manage to do it?'

   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.'

   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made you so awfully clever?'

   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'


'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.

'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
have got altered.'

'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

'What size do you want to be?' it asked.

'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know.'

'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'

'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!'

'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.'

'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.

'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand.

'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.


  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
was beating her violently with its wings.

'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.

'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'

'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems
to suit them!'

'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.

'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
serpents! There's no pleasing them!'

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'

'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'

'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'

'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to
invent something!'

'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use
denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg!'

'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.'

'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'

'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
like them raw.'

'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives
there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper

For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'

'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she
said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she
repeated, aloud.

'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
question, you know.'

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!'

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for
days and days.'

'But what am I to do?' said Alice.

'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.

'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
your cat grins like that?'

'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats COULD grin.'

'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'

'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'

'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'

'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
it twelve? I--'

'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
every line:

   'Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.'

         CHORUS.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--

       'Wow! wow! wow!'

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

   'I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!'

         CHORUS.

       'Wow! wow! wow!'

'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.'

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
tears.

No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'

'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.

'I don't much care where--' said Alice.

'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.

'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.

'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
enough.'

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
'What sort of people live about here?'

'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'

'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.

'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad.'

'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
do you know that you're mad?'

'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'

'I suppose so,' said Alice.

'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'

'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.

'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?'

'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
yet.'

'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
forgotten to ask.'

'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.

'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'

'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'




CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
suppose it doesn't mind.'

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.

'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.

'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
the March Hare.

'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
many more than three.'

'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
severity; 'it's very rude.'

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'

'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.

'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
March Hare.

'Exactly so,' said Alice.

'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know.'

'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
as "I sleep when I breathe"!'

'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn't much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'

'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.

'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
you know.'

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!'

'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
year it is?'

'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.'

'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.

'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'

'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'

'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.

'Nor I,' said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'

'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
about wasting IT. It's HIM.'

'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music.'

'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!'

('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'

'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.'

'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We
quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

     "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you're at!"

You know the song, perhaps?'

'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.

'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--

     "Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--"'

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.

'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with his
head!"'

'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.

'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't
do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'

A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?' she asked.

'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,
and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'

'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.

'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'

'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
to ask.

'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'

'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'

'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.

'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
before it's done.'

'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--'

'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
have been ill.'

'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't
take more.'

'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing.'

'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, 'It was a treacle-well.'

'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.'

'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
dare say there may be ONE.'

'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--'

'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place
on.'

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?'

'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'

'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M--'

'Why with an M?' said Alice.

'Why not?' said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?'

'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
think--'

'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
my life!'

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But
everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains.




CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground

A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like
that!'

'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my
elbow.'

On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!'

'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.

'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.

'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust
things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
all of them bowed low.

'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting
those roses?'

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of
a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'

'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn't be afraid of them!'

'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
courtiers, or three of her own children.

'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no
business of MINE.'

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'

'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!'

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
over!'

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'

'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.

'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
in reply.

'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

'Yes!' shouted Alice.

'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'

'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under
sentence of execution.'

'What for?' said Alice.

'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.

'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
"What for?"'

'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said--'

'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
left alive!'

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'

'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use
speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!'

'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.

'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'

The Queen smiled and passed on.

'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
at the Cat's head with great curiosity.

'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to
introduce it.'

'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.'

'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.

'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
He got behind Alice as he spoke.

'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where.'

'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!'

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.

'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.

The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.

The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
you'd better ask HER about it.'

'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story

'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
stingy about it, you know--'

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.'

'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.

'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'

'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
their own business!'

'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves."'

'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.

'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'

'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried.

'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'

'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.

'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
putting things!'

'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.

'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours."'

'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'

'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'

'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if
I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'

'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in
a pleased tone.

'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said
Alice.

'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present
of everything I've said as yet.'

'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give
birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and
the m--'

But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!'

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her
head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'

'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'

'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.

'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.

'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good
thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy
thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with
the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

'What IS the fun?' said Alice.

'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!'

'Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your
history, she do.'

'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit
down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
she waited patiently.

'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
Turtle.'

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'

'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.

'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
angrily: 'really you are very dull!'

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
and he went on in these words:

'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'

'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.

'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.

'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'

'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
as all that.'

'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'

'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.

'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.

'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
"French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'

'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
the sea.'

'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I
only took the regular course.'

'What was that?' inquired Alice.

'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'

'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'

'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'

'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.'

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'

'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.'

'What was THAT like?' said Alice.

'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'

'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was.'

'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'

'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.

'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so
on.'

'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.

'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
'because they lessen from day to day.'

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?'

'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.

'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.

'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: 'tell her something about the games now.'




CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said
Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and
said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!'

'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'

'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--'

'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'

'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.

'--you advance twice--'

'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.

'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'

'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.

'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'

'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

'--as far out to sea as you can--'

'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.

'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.

'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.

'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.

'Very much indeed,' said Alice.

'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'

'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
 "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.

 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?

 "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
 But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

 '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
 "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"'

'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!'

'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,
of course?'

'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself
hastily.

'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'

'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'

'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her
about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.

'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
them out again. That's all.'

'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.'

'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
know why it's called a whiting?'

'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'

'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated
in a wondering tone.

'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what
makes them so shiny?'

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'

'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'

'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
'any shrimp could have told you that.'

'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we
don't want YOU with us!"'

'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'

'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'

'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.

'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'

'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said
Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.'

'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.

'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
'explanations take such a dreadful time.'

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said 'That's very curious.'

'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.

'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
Gryphon.

'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'
thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'

       [later editions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]

'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the
Gryphon.

'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.'

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.

'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.

'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
verse.'

'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
out with his nose, you know?'

'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it
begins "I passed by his garden."'

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet--]

'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!'

'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'

'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, old
fellow?'

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'

'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the
distance.

'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'




CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
herself, 'because of his great wig.'

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'
(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they
doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put
down yet, before the trial's begun.'

'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'

'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away!'

'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.

'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
deal to come before that!'

'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.'

'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
was,' he said.

'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.

'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.

'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.

'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.

'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact.

'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
my own. I'm a hatter.'

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot.'

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'

'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'

'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.

'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
too.'

'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not.'

'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'

'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.

'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.

'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!'

'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--'

'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

'You did!' said the Hatter.

'I deny it!' said the March Hare.

'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'

'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'

'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.

'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.

'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.

'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'

'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
King.

'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'

'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
on better.'

'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

'Call the next witness!' said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

'Give your evidence,' said the King.

'Shan't,' said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'

'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.

'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.

'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!'

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!'

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name 'Alice!'




CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence


'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before.

'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.

'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
one way up as the other.'

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.

'Nothing,' said Alice.

'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.

'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule
Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

Everybody looked at Alice.

'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

'You are,' said the King.

'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.

'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.'

'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your
verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked
up.'

'What's in it?' said the Queen.

'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'

'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'

'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.

'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'

'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.

'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)

'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they
can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'

'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man.'

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
what they're about!'

'Read them,' said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?' he asked.

'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.'

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

   'They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

   Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.'

'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the
King, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'

'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of
meaning in it.'

The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.

'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the
Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
course--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--'

'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.

'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts
on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
Queen.

'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)

'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. There was a dead silence.

'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,
'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the
twentieth time that day.

'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the
sentence first!'

'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

'I won't!' said Alice.

'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this
time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've
had!'

'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister's dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

                                      LUCASFILM LTD.



               A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
               Threepio, on the other Hand, is a tall, slender robot of
               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
               surface of an Art Deco design.

               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Did you hear that? They've shut down
                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
                         for sure. This is madness!

               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed!

               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
               only another robot could understand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         There'll be no escape for the Princess
                         this time.

               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What's that?

               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
               arms and faces.

               An explosion hits near the robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I should have known better tHan to
                         trust the logic of a half-sized
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
               around the two hapless robots.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
               who looks much younger tHan his eighteen years. His shaggy
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke eye and
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his
               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the
               tiny robot to follow him.

                                     LUKE
                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
                         waiting for?! Get in gear!

               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his
               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps
               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum
               madly.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
               Darth Vader, right Hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through
               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run
               in a frenzied panic.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               A woman's Hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years
               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
               robot joins his companion.

                                     THREEPIO
                         At last! Where have you been?

               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're heading in this direction.
                         What are we going to do? We'll be
                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
                         smashed into who knows what!

               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait a minute, where are you going?

               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
                         The Death Star plans are not in the
                         main computer.

               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
               in vain.

                                     VADER
                         Where are those transmissions you
                         intercepted?

               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                                     VADER
                         What have you done with those plans?

                                     REBEL OFFICER
                         We intercepted no transmissions.
                         Aaah... This is a consular ship.
                         Were on a diplomatic mission.

                                     VADER
                         If this is a consular ship... were
                         is the Ambassador?

               The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
               Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
               Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
               his troops.

                                     VADER
                         Commander, tear this ship apart until
                         you've found those plans and bring
                         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the
               troopers spots her.

                                     TROOPER
                         There she is! Set for stun!

               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

                                     TROOPER
                         She'll be all right. Inform Lord
                         Vader we have a prisoner.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.
               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into
               the cramped four-man pod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hey, you're not permitted in there.
                         It's restricted. You'll be deactivated
                         for sure..

               Artoo beeps something to him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
                         you overweight glob of grease! Now
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
               the mission he is about to perform.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Secret mission? What plans? What are
                         you talking about? I'm not getting
                         in there!

               Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
               and twangs angrily.

               A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
               through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm going to regret this.

               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

               On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
               robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

                                     CHIEF PILOT
                         There goes another one.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hold your fire. There are no life
                         forms. It must have been short-
                         circuited.

               INT. LIFEPOD

               Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
               Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's funny, the damage doesn't
                         look as bad from out here.

               Artoo beeps an assuring response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Are you sure this things safe?

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
               buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty
               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist
               at Luke as he flies past.

                                     WOMAN
                         I've told you kids to slow down!

               INT. POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
               mecHanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
               office, yelling wildly.

                                     FIXER
                         Did I hear a young noise blast through
                         here?

                                     CAMIE
                         It was just wormie on another rampage.

               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
               Handsome boy a few years older tHan the rest. His flashy
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics
               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the
               background.

                                     LUKE
                         Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

               Luke surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great
               joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't know you were back! When
                         did you get in?

                                     BIGGS
                         Just now. I wanted to surprise you,
                         hot shot. I thought you'd be here...
                         certainly didn't expect you to be
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

                                     LUKE
                         The Academy didn't cHange you
                         much...but you're back so soon? Hey,
                         what happened, didn't you get your
                         commission?

               Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                                     BIGGS
                         Of course I got it. Signed aboard
                         The Rand Ecliptic last week. First
                         mate Biggs Darklighter at your
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...I just came to say good-bye to
                         all you unfortunate landlocked
                         simpletons.

               Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend
               is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of
               it.

                                     LUKE
                         I almost forgot. There's a battle
                         going on! Right here in our system.
                         Come and look!

                                     DEAK
                         Not again! Forget it.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -
               DAY

               The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie
               and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
               Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

                                     LUKE
                         There they are!

               Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to
               see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
               Biggs sees two small silver specks.

                                     BIGGS
                         That's no battle, hot shot... they're
                         just sitting there! Probably a
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

                                     LUKE
                         But there was a lot of firing
                         earlier...

               Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
               building in the process. Luke grabs them.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, easy with those...

                                     CAMIE
                         Don't worry about it, Wormie.

               The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs
               his shoulders in resignation.

                                     FIXER
                         I keep telling you, the Rebellion is
                         a long way from here. I doubt if the
                         Empire would even fight to keep this
                         system. Believe me Luke, this planet
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
               Luke ineptitude.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
               of armored stormtroopers. Her Hands are bound and she is
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     LEIA
                         Lord Vader, I should have known.
                         Only you could be so bold. The
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for
                         this, when they hear you've attacked
                         a diplomatic...

                                     VADER
                         Don't play games with me, Your
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy
                         mission this time. You passed directly
                         through a restricted system. Several
                         transmissions were beamed to this
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
                         what happened to the plans they sent
                         you.

                                     LEIA
                         I don't know what you're talking
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to
                         Alderaan...

                                     VADER
                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander
               turns to Vader.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Holding her is dangerous. If word of
                         this gets out, it could generate
                         sympathy for the Rebellion in the
                         senate.

                                     VADER
                         I have traced the Rebel spies to
                         her. Now she is my only link to find
                         their secret base!

                                     COMMANDER
                         She'll die before she tells you
                         anything.

                                     VADER
                         Leave that to me. Send a distress
                         signal and then inform the senate
                         that all aboard were killed!

               Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
               They stop and snap to attention.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Lord Vader, the battle station plans
                         are not aboard this ship! And no
                         transmissions were made. An escape
                         pod was jettisoned during the
                         fighting, but no life forms were
                         aboard.

               Vader turns to the Commander.

                                     VADER
                         She must have hidden the plans in
                         the escape pod. Send a detachment
                         down to retrieve them. See to it
                         personally, Commander. There'll be
                         no one to stop us this time.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Yes, sir.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
               planet Tatooine.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

               Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
               meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
               work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         How did I get into this mess? I really
                         don't know how. We seem to be made
                         to suffer. It's our lot in life.

               Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I've got to rest before I fall apart.
                         My joints are almost frozen.

               Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What a desolate place this is.

               Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
               stops and yells at him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where are you going?

               A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
               robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Well, I'm not going that way. It's
                         much too rocky. This way is much
                         easier.

               Artoo counters with a long whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What makes you think there are
                         settlements over there?

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't get technical with me.

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What mission? What are you talking
                         about? I've had just about enough of
                         you! Go that way! You'll be
                         malfunctioning within a day, you
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the
               direction of the vast dune sea.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And don't let me catch you following
                         me begging for help, because you
                         won't get it.

               Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No more adventures. I'm not going
                         that way.

               Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant
               mountains.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

               Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
               miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant
               rock mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That malfunctioning little twerp.
                         This is all his fault! He tricked me
                         into going this way, but he'll do no
                         better.

               In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand
               from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
               towards him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm
                         saved!

               The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
               approaching transport.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Over here! Help! Please, help!

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                                     LUKE
                              (Very animated)
                         ...so I cut off my power, shut down
                         the afterburners and came in low on
                         Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
                         I was going to fry my instruments.
                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty
                         upset. He grounded me for the rest
                         of the season. You should have been
                         there... it was fantastic.

                                     BIGGS
                         You ought to take it easy Luke. You
                         may be the hottest bushpilot this
                         side of Mos Eisley, but those little
                         Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it
                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going
                         to be nothing more tHan a dark spot
                         on the down side of a canyon wall.

                                     LUKE
                         Look who's talking. Now that you've
                         been around those giant starships
                         you're beginning to sound like my
                         uncle. You've gotten soft in the
                         city...

                                     BIGGS
                         I've missed you kid.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, things haven't been the same
                         since you left, Biggs. It's been
                         so... quiet.

               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke, I didn't come back just to say
                         good-bye... I shouldn't tell you
                         this, but you're the only one I can
                         trust... and if I don't come back, I
                         want somebody to know.

               Luke eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BIGGS
                         I made some friends at the Academy.
                              (he whispers)
                         ...when our frigate goes to one of
                         the central systems, we're going to
                         jump ship and join the Alliance...

               Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                                     LUKE
                         Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!
                         How?

                                     BIGGS
                         Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth
                         bigger tHan a meteor crater!

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
                              (he whispers)
                         Listen how quiet I am. You can barely
                         hear me...

               Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                                     BIGGS
                         My friend has a friend on Bestine
                         who might help us make contact.

                                     LUKE
                         You're crazy! You could wander around
                         forever trying to find them.

                                     BIGGS
                         I know it's a long shot, but if I
                         don't find them I'll do what I can
                         on my own... It's what we always
                         talked about. Luke, I'm not going to
                         wait for the Empire to draft me into
                         service. The Rebellion is spreading
                         and I want to be on the right side --
                         the side I believe in.

                                     LUKE
                         And I'm stuck here...

                                     BIGGS
                         I thought you were going to the
                         Academy next term. You'll get your
                         cHance to get off this rock.

                                     LUKE
                         Not likely! I had to cancel my
                         application. There has been a lot of
                         unrest among the Sandpeople since
                         you left... they've even raided the
                         outskirts of Anchorhead.

                                     BIGGS
                         Your uncle could hold off a whole
                         colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.

                                     LUKE
                         I know, but he's got enough vaporators
                         going to make the place pay off. He
                         needs me for just one more season. I
                         can't leave him now.

                                     BIGGS
                         I feel for you, Luke, you're going
                         to have to learn what seems to be
                         important or what really is important.
                         What good is all your uncle's work
                         if it's taken over by the Empire?...
                         You know they're starting to
                         nationalize commerce in the central
                         systems... it won't be long before
                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving
                         for the greater glory of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         It couldn't happen here. You said it
                         yourself. The Empire won't bother
                         with this rock.

                                     BIGGS
                         Things always cHange.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I was going... Are you going
                         to be around long?

                                     BIGGS
                         No, I'm leaving in the morning...

                                     LUKE
                         Then I guess I won't see you.

                                     BIGGS
                         Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll be at the Academy next
                         season... after that who knows. I
                         won't be drafted into the Imperial
                         Starfleet that's for sure... Take
                         care of yourself, you'll always be
                         the best friend I've got.

                                     BIGGS
                         So long, Luke.

               Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the
               power station.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he
               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for
               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the
               narrow path.

               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his
               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then
               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller
               tHan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down
               the trail.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a
               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
               of the chamber.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various
               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,
               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls
               out from the gloom.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
               ridge.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.
               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks
                         go off in this direction.

               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
               and gives it to the first trooper.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Look, sir -- droids.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER

               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wake up! Wake up!

               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,
               creating quite a commotion among the mecHanical men.
               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights
               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding
               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the
               odd assortment of robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed.

               A Jawa starts moving toward them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Do you think they'll melt us down?

               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this
                         never end?

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of
               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
               adobe block house.

               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.
               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils
               should be.

               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru
               standing in the main courtyard.

                                     BERU
                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a
                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like we don't have much of
                         a choice but I'll remind him.

               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
               for sale with the Jawa leader.

                                     OWEN
                         I have no need for a protocol droid.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (quickly)
                         Sir -- not in an environment such as
                         this -- that's why I've also been
                         programmed for over thirty secondary
                         functions that...

                                     OWEN
                         What I really need is a droid that
                         understands the binary language of
                         moisture vaporators.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was
                         programming binary load lifter...
                         very similar to your vaporators. You
                         could say...

                                     OWEN
                         Do you speak Bocce?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Of course I can, sir. It's like a
                         second language for me... I'm as
                         fluent in Bocce...

                                     OWEN
                         All right shut up!
                              (turning to Jawa)
                         I'll take this one.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Shutting up, sir.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, take these two over to the
                         garage, will you? I want you to have
                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

                                     LUKE
                         But I was going into Toshi Station
                         to pick up some power converters...

                                     OWEN
                         You can waste time with your friends
                         when your chores are done. Now come
                         on, get to it!

                                     LUKE
                         All right, come on! And the red one,
                         come on. Well, come on, Red, let's
                         go.

               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back
               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep
               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained
               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
                         Look!

                                     OWEN
                              (to the head Jawa)
                         Hey, what're you trying to push on
                         us?

               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract
               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps
               Luke on the shoulder.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (pointing to Artoo)
                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is
                         in prime condition. A real bargain.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         What about that one?

                                     OWEN
                              (to Jawa)
                         What about that blue one? We'll take
                         that one.

               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged
               astro-droid for Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, take it away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very
                         pleased with that one, sir. He really
                         is in first-class condition. I've
                         worked with him before. Here he comes.

               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay, let's go.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I
                         should stick my neck out for you is
                         quite beyond my capacity!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the
               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery
               with a cord to his face.

                                     THREEPIO
                         THank the maker! This oil bath is
                         going to feel so good. I've got such
                         a bad case of dust contamination, I
                         can barely move!

               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought
               as he runs his Hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man
               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low Hangar off the garage.
               Finally Luke frustrations get the better of him and he
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

                                     LUKE
                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is
                         right. I'm never gonna get out of
                         here!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Is there anything I might do to help?

               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, not unless you can alter time,
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me
                         off this rock!

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a
                         droid and not very knowledgeable
                         about such things. Not on this planet,
                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm
                         not even sure which planet I'm on.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, if there's a bright center to
                         the universe, you're on the planet
                         that it's farthest from.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Uh, you can call me Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir Luke.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Just Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg
                         relations, and this is my counterpart,
                         Artoo-Detoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hello.

               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping
               oil from his bronze body.

                                     LUKE
                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
                         It looks like you boys have seen a
                         lot of action.

                                     THREEPIO
                         With all we've been through, sometimes
                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition
                         as we are, what with the Rebellion
                         and all.

                                     LUKE
                         You know of the Rebellion against
                         the Empire?

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's how we came to be in your
                         service, if you take my meaning,
                         sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Have you been in many battles?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Several, I think. Actually, there's
                         not much to tell. I'm not much more
                         tHan an interpreter, and not very
                         good at telling stories. Well, not
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's
               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, my little friend, you've got
                         something jammed in here real good.
                         Were you on a cruiser or...

               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling
               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being
               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly
               lit garage. Luke mouth Hangs open in awe.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
                         only hope.

                                     LUKE
                         What's this?

               Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio
               to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment
               over and over.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What is what?!? He asked you a
                         question...
                              (pointing to Leia)
                         What is that?

               Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
               the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer
               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the
               sentence fragment over and over.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
                         only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
                         You're my only hope.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely
                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no
                         mind.

               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                                     LUKE
                         Who is she? She's beautiful.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

                                     THREEPIO
                         I think she was a passenger on our
                         last voyage. A person of some
                         importance, sir -- I believe. Our
                         captain was attached to...

                                     LUKE
                         Is there more to this recording?

               Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic
               squeaks and a whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going
                         to get us in trouble. It's all right,
                         you can trust him. He's our new
                         master.

               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
                         And it's a private message for him.
                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what
                         he's talking about. Our last master
                         was Captain Antilles, but with what
                         we've been through, this little R2
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

                                     LUKE
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means
                         old Ben Kenobi?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
                         know what he's talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                         Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond
                         the dune sea. He's kind of a strange
                         old hermit.

               Luke gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
               moments.

                                     LUKE
                         I wonder who she is. It sounds like
                         she's in trouble. I'd better play
                         back the whole thing.

               Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says the restraining bolt has
                         short circuited his recording system.
                         He suggests that if you remove the
                         bolt, he might be able to play back
                         the entire recording.

               Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't
               really heard what Threepio has been saying.

                                     LUKE
                         H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're
                         too small to run away on me if I
                         take this off! Okay.

               Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
               Artoo's side.

                                     LUKE
                         There you go.

               The princess immediately disappears...

                                     LUKE
                         Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go?
                         Bring her back! Play back the entire
                         message.

               Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in
               embarrassment.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What message? The one you're carrying
                         inside your rusty innards!

               A women's voice calls out from another room.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

               Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
               robot.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be right there, Aunt
                         Beru.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
               hurries out of the room.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, see what you can do with him.
                         I'll be right back.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Just you reconsider playing that
                         message for him.

               Artoo beeps in response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't think he likes you at
                         all.

               Artoo beeps.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't like you either.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

               Luke Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with
               steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red
               grain.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, I think that R2 unit we
                         bought might have been stolen.

                                     OWEN
                         What makes you think that?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I stumbled across a recording
                         while I was cleaning him. He says he
                         belongs to someone called Obi-Wan
                         Kenobi.

               Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
               manages to control himself.

                                     LUKE
                         I thought he might have meant old
                         Ben. Do you know what he's talking
                         about? Well, I wonder if he's related
                         to Ben.

               Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                                     OWEN
                         That old man's just a crazy old
                         wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take
                         that R2 unit into Anchorhead and
                         have its memory flushed. That'll be
                         the end of it. It belongs to us now.

                                     LUKE
                         But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking
                         for him?

                                     OWEN
                         He won't, I don't think he exists
                         any more. He died about the same
                         time as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         He knew my father?

                                     OWEN
                         I told you to forget it. Your only
                         concern is to prepare the new droids
                         for tomorrow. In the morning I want
                         them on the south ridge working out
                         those condensers.

                                     LUKE
                         Yes, sir. I think those new droids
                         are going to work out fine. In fact,
                         I, uh, was also thinking about our
                         agreement about my staying on another
                         season. And if these new droids do
                         work out, I want to transmit my
                         application to the Academy this year.

               Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
               it.

                                     OWEN
                         You mean the next semester before
                         harvest?

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, there're more tHan enough
                         droids.

                                     OWEN
                         Harvest is when I need you the most.
                         Only one more season. This year we'll
                         make enough on the harvest so I'll
                         be able to hire some more Hands. And
                         then you can go to the Academy next
                         year.

               Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

                                     OWEN
                         You must understand I need you here,
                         Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         But it's a whole 'nother year.

                                     OWEN
                         Look, it's only one more season.

               Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, that's what you said last year
                         when Biggs and Tank left.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Where are you going?

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like I'm going nowhere. I
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen
               mecHanically finishes his dinner.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Owen, he can't stay here forever.
                         Most of his friends have gone. It
                         means so much to him.

                                     OWEN
                         I'll make it up to him next year. I
                         promise.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke just not a farmer, Owen. He
                         has too much of his father in him.

                                     OWEN
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a
               distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the
               homestead.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

               Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in
               sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt
               similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the
               box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a
               short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you doing hiding there?

               Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in
               sight.

                                     THREEPIO
                         It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't
                         deactivate me. I told him not to go,
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning;
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the
               salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his
               electrobinoculars.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That R2 unit has always been a
                         problem. These astro-droids are
                         getting quite out of Hand. Even I
                         can't understand their logic at times.

                                     LUKE
                         How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere
                         in sight. Blast it!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go
                         after him?

                                     LUKE
                         It's too dangerous with all the
                         Sandpeople around. We'll have to
                         wait until morning.

               Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, I'm shutting the power down
                         for the night.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be there in a few
                         minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

               He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                                     LUKE
                         You know that little droid is going
                         to cause me a lot of trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he excels at that, sir.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

               Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of
               the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of
               Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be
                         loafing now!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

               The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru
               prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

                                     OWEN
                         Have you seen Luke this morning?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         He said he had some things to do
                         before he started today, so he left
                         early.

                                     OWEN
                         Uh? Did he take those two new droids
                         with him?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         I think so.

                                     OWEN
                         Well, he'd better have those units
                         in the south range repaired be midday
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - Luke SPEEDER - DAY

               The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio
               pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast
               wasteland.

               INT./EXT. Luke SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -
               DAY

               Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something
               in the motor compartment.

                                     LUKE
                              (yelling)
                         How's that.

               Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                                     LUKE
                         Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this
                         direction somewhere, but I don't see
                         how that R2 unit could have come
                         this far. We must have missed him.
                         Uncle Owen isn't going to take this
                         very well.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, would it help if you told him
                         it was my fault.

                                     LUKE
                              (brightening)
                         Sure. He needs you. He'd probably
                         only deactivate you for a day or
                         so...

                                     THREEPIO
                         Deactivate! Well, on the other Hand
                         if you hadn't removed his restraining
                         bolt...

                                     LUKE
                         Wait, there's something dead ahead
                         on the scanner. It looks like our
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

               From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen
               gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground
               two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs
               the gun before it can be fired.

               The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called,
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an
               animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

               The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied
               to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large
               as elepHants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

               The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke,
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands
               before little Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, whoa, just where do you think
                         you're going?

               The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke here is your rightful
                         owner. We'll have no more of this
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't
                         talk to me about your mission, either.
                         You're fortunate he doesn't blast
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, come on. It's getting late. I
                         only hope we can get back before
                         Uncle Owen really blows up.

                                     THREEPIO
                         If you don't mind my saying so, sir,
                         I think you should deactivate the
                         little fugitive until you've gotten
                         him back to your workshop.

                                     LUKE
                         No, he's not going to try anything.

               Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic
               whistles and screams.

                                     LUKE
                         What's wrong with him now?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh my... sir, he says there are
                         several creatures approaching from
                         the southeast.

               Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                                     LUKE
                         Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's
                         have a look. Come on.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the
               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young
               adventurer.

                                     LUKE
                         There are two Banthas down there but
                         I don't see any... wait a second,
                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can
                         see one of them now.

               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of
               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,
               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles
               down the side of the mountain.

               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in
               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.
               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced
               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible
               shrieking laugh.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in
               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the
               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the
               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts
               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then
               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the
               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and
               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a
               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

                                     BEN
                         Hello there! Come here my little
                         friend. Don't be afraid.

               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his Hand on
               Luke forehead and he begins to come around.

                                     BEN
                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                                     LUKE
                         What happened?

                                     BEN
                         Rest easy, son, you've had a busy
                         day. You're fortunate you're still
                         in one piece.

                                     LUKE
                         Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to
                         see you!

                                     BEN
                         The Jundland wastes are not to be
                         traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke,
                         what brings you out this far?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, this little droid! I think he's
                         searching for his former master...
                         I've never seen such devotion in a
                         droid before... there seems to be no
                         stopping him. He claims to be the
                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he
                         a relative of yours? Do you know who
                         he's talking about?

               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

                                     BEN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats
                         a name I haven't heard in a long
                         time... a long time.

                                     LUKE
                         I think my uncle knew him. He said
                         he was dead.

                                     BEN
                         Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know him!

                                     BEN
                         Well of course, of course I know
                         him. He's me! I haven't gone by the
                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you
                         were born.

                                     LUKE
                         Then the droid does belong to you.

                                     BEN
                         Don't seem to remember ever owning a
                         droid. Very interesting...

               He suddenly looks up at the overHanging cliffs.

                                     BEN
                         I think we better get indoors. The
                         Sandpeople are easily startled but
                         they will soon be back and in greater
                         numbers.

               Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic
               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio!

               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and
               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half
               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally
               the mecHanical man's systems turn on.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where am I? I must have taken a bad
                         step...

                                     LUKE
                         Can you stand? We've got to get out
                         of here before the Sandpeople return.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think I can make it. You go
                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in
                         you risking yourself on my account.
                         I'm done for.

               Artoo makes a beeping sound.

                                     LUKE
                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is
                         that?

               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little
               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around
               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the
               air.

                                     BEN
                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.

               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as
               old Ben sits thinking.

                                     LUKE
                         No, my father didn't fight in the
                         wars. He was a navigator on a spice
                         freighter.

                                     BEN
                         That's what your uncle told you. He
                         didn't hold with your father's ideals.
                         Thought he should have stayed here
                         and not gotten involved.

                                     LUKE
                         You fought in the Clone Wars?

                                     BEN
                         Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the
                         same as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I'd known him.

                                     BEN
                         He was the best star-pilot in the
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I
                         understand you've become quite a
                         good pilot yourself. And he was a
                         good friend. Which reminds me...

               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the
               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short Handle
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                                     BEN
                         I have something here for you. Your
                         father wanted you to have this when
                         you were old enough, but your uncle
                         wouldn't allow it. He feared you
                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like
                         your father did.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
                         I'll close down for awhile.

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, go ahead.

               Ben Hands Luke the saber.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     BEN
                         Your fathers lightsaber. This is the
                         weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy
                         or as random as a blaster.

               Luke pushes a button on the Handle. A long beam shoots out
               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across
               the ceiling.

                                     BEN
                         An elegant weapon for a more civilized
                         time. For over a thousand generations
                         the Jedi Knights were the guardians
                         of peace and justice in the Old
                         Republic. Before the dark times,
                         before the Empire.

               Luke hasn't really been listening.

                                     LUKE
                         How did my father die?

                                     BEN
                         A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who
                         was a pupil of mine until he turned
                         to evil, helped the Empire hunt down
                         and destroy the Jedi Knights. He
                         betrayed and murdered your father.
                         Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
                         Vader was seduced by the dark side
                         of the Force.

                                     LUKE
                         The Force?

                                     BEN
                         Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi
                         his power. It's an energy field
                         created by all living things. It
                         surrounds us and penetrates us. It
                         binds the galaxy together.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     BEN
                         Now, let's see if we can't figure
                         out what you are, my little friend.
                         And where you come from.

                                     LUKE
                         I saw part of the message he was...

               Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
               young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                                     BEN
                         I seem to have found it.

               Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before
               his eyes.

                                     LEIA
                         General Kenobi, years ago you served
                         my father in the Clone Wars. Now he
                         begs you to help him in his struggle
                         against the Empire. I regret that I
                         am unable to present my father's
                         request to you in person, but my
                         ship has fallen under attack and I'm
                         afraid my mission to bring you to
                         Alderaan has failed. I have placed
                         information vital to the survival of
                         the Rebellion into the memory systems
                         of this R2 unit. My father will know
                         how to retrieve it. You must see
                         this droid safely delivered to him
                         on Alderaan. This is our most
                         desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan
                         Kenobi, you're my only hope.

               There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
               Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

                                     BEN
                         You must learn the ways of the Force
                         if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
                         I've got to go home. It's late, I'm
                         in for it as it is.

                                     BEN
                         I need your help, Luke. She needs
                         your help. I'm getting too old for
                         this sort of thing.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't get involved! I've got work
                         to do! It's not that I like the
                         Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing
                         I can do about it right now. It's
                         such a long way from here.

                                     BEN
                         That's your uncle talking.

                                     LUKE
                              (sighing)
                         Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever
                         going to explain this?

                                     BEN
                         Learn about the Force, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Look, I can take you as far as
                         Anchorhead. You can get a transport
                         there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
                         going.

                                     BEN
                         You must do what you feel is right,
                         of course.

               EXT. SPACE.

               An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
               battle station: the Death Star!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black
               conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
               the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,
               is speaking.

                                     TAGGE
                         Until this battle station is fully
                         operational we are vulnerable. The
                         Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
                         They're more dangerous tHan you
                         realize.

               The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

                                     MOTTI
                         Dangerous to your starfleet,
                         Commander, not to this battle station!

                                     TAGGE
                         The Rebellion will continue to gain
                         a support in the Imperial Senate as
                         long as....

               Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut
               short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial
               outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,
               The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his
               place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind
               him.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Imperial Senate will no longer
                         be of any concern to us. I've just
                         received word that the Emperor has
                         dissolved the council permanently.
                         The last remnants of the Old Republic
                         have been swept away.

                                     TAGGE
                         That's impossible! How will the
                         Emperor maintain control without the
                         bureaucracy?

                                     TARKIN
                         The regional governors now have direct
                         control over territories. Fear will
                         keep the local systems in line. Fear
                         of this battle station.

                                     TAGGE
                         And what of the Rebellion? If the
                         Rebels have obtained a complete
                         technical readout of this station,
                         it is possible, however unlikely,
                         that they might find a weakness and
                         exploit it.

                                     VADER
                         The plans you refer to will soon be
                         back in our Hands.

                                     MOTTI
                         Any attack made by the Rebels against
                         this station would be a useless
                         gesture, no matter what technical
                         data they've obtained. This station
                         is now the ultimate power in the
                         universe. I suggest we use it!

                                     VADER
                         Don't be too proud of this
                         technological terror you've
                         constructed. The ability to destroy
                         a planet is insignificant next to
                         the power of the Force.

                                     MOTTI
                         Don't try to frighten us with your
                         sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your
                         sad devotion to that ancient religion
                         has not helped you conjure up the
                         stolen data tapes, or given you
                         clairvoyance enough to find the
                         Rebel's hidden fort...

               Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's
               spell.

                                     VADER
                         I find your lack of faith disturbing.

                                     TARKIN
                         Enough of this! Vader, release him!

                                     VADER
                         As you wish.

                                     TARKIN
                         This bickering is pointless. Lord
                         Vader will provide us with the
                         location of the Rebel fortress by
                         the time this station is operational.
                         We will then crush the Rebellion
                         with one swift stroke.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas
               Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble
               and scattered bodies.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like Sandpeople did this,
                         all right. Look, here are Gaffi
                         sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...
                         I never heard of them hitting anything
                         this big before.

               Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                                     BEN
                         They didn't. But we are meant to
                         think they did. These tracks are
                         side by side. Sandpeople always ride
                         single file to hide there numbers.

                                     LUKE
                         These are the same Jawas that sold
                         us Artoo and Threepio.

                                     BEN
                         And these blast points, too accurate
                         for Sandpeople. Only Imperial
                         stormtroopers are so precise.

                                     LUKE
                         Why would Imperial troops want to
                         slaughter Jawas?

               Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are
               inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

                                     LUKE
                         If they traced the robots here, they
                         may have learned who they sold them
                         to. And that would lead them home!

               Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for
               the speeder and jumps it.

                                     BEN
                         Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

               Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the
               burning Sandcrawler.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps
               out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.
               Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great
               battle has taken place.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

               Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.
               Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is
               stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new
               resolve comes over him.

               EXT. SPACE

               Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
               several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is
               filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a
               giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                                     VADER
                         And, now Your Highness, we will
                         discuss the location of your hidden
                         Rebel base.

               The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it
               approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mecHanical
               arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut
               and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled
               screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of
               the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the
               dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to
               him.

                                     BEN
                         There's nothing you could have done,
                         Luke, had you been there. You'd have
                         been killed, too, and the droids
                         would be in the Hands of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to come with you to Alderaan.
                         There's nothing here for me now. I
                         want to learn the ways of the Force
                         and become a Jedi like my father.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it
               zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff
               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard
               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A
               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts
               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where
               Ben is standing.

                                     BEN
                         Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never
                         find a more wretched hive of scum
                         and villainy. We must be cautious.

               Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
               smile.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
               hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper
               questions Luke.

                                     TROOPER
                         How long have you had these droids?

                                     LUKE
                         About three or four seasons.

                                     BEN
                         They're for sale if you want them.

                                     TROOPER
                         Let me see your identification.

               Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while
               Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                                     BEN
                         You don't need to see his
                         identification.

                                     TROOPER
                         We don't need to see his
                         identification.

                                     BEN
                         These are not the droids your looking
                         for.

                                     TROOPER
                         These are not the droids we're looking
                         for.

                                     BEN
                         He can go about his business.

                                     TROOPER
                         You can go about your business.

                                     BEN
                              (to Luke)
                         Move along.

                                     TROOPER
                         Move along. Move along.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina
               on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of
               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are
               parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle
               the speeder.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting
                         creatures.

               As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa
               away.

                                     LUKE
                         Go on, go on. I can't understand how
                         we got by those troopers. I thought
                         we were dead.

                                     BEN
                         The Force can have a strong influence
                         on the weak-minded. You will find it
                         a powerful ally.

                                     LUKE
                         Do you really think we're going to
                         find a pilot here that'll take us to
                         Alderaan?

                                     BEN
                         Well, most of the best freighter
                         pilots can be found here. Only watch
                         your step. This place can be a little
                         rough.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm ready for anything.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come along, Artoo.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               The young adventurer and his two mecHanical servants follow
               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy
               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic
               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At
               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,
               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over
               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group
               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender
               stops Luke and the robots.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We don't serve their kind here!

               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many
               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's
               drift.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Your droids. They'll have to wait
                         outside. We don't want them here.

               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the
               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures
               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                                     LUKE
                         Listen, why don't you wait out by
                         the speeder. We don't want any
                         trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I heartily agree with you sir.

               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the
               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with
               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,
               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a
               sight to behold.

               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more tHan a little bit
               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between
               Ben and the giant Wookiee.

               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear
               or whatever.

               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

                                     CREATURE
                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby
               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the
               belligerent monstrosity.

                                     HUMAN
                         He doesn't like you.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HUMAN
                         I don't like you either.

               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some
               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young
               adventurer.

                                     HUMAN
                         Don't insult us. You just watch
                         yourself. We're wanted men. I have
                         the death sentence in twelve systems.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll be careful tHan.

                                     HUMAN
                         You'll be dead.

               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His
               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind
               Luke.

                                     BEN
                         This little one isn't worth the
                         effort. Come let me buy you
                         something...

               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young
               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables
               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.
               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked
               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.
               The bartender panics.

                                     BARTENDER
                         No blasters! No blaster!

               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life
               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut
               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,
               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns
               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.
               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,
               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter
               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is
               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing
               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben
               points the the Wookiee.

                                     BEN
                         This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate
                         on a ship that might suit our needs.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on
               an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
               droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches
               two stormtroopers in the street.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't like the look of this.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
               instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and
               follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is
               sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years
               old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental,
               and cocksure.

                                     Han
                         Han Solo. I'm captain of the
                         Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells
                         me you're looking for passage to the
                         Alderaan system.

                                     BEN
                         Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

                                     Han
                         Fast ship? You've never heard of the
                         Millennium Falcon?

                                     BEN
                         Should I have?

                                     Han
                         It's the ship that made the Kessel
                         run in less tHan twelve parsecs!

               Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with
               obvious misinformation.

                                     Han
                         I've outrun Imperial starships, not
                         the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
                         I'm talking about the big Corellian
                         ships now. She's fast enough for
                         you, old man. What's the cargo?

                                     BEN
                         Only passengers. Myself, the boy,
                         two droids, and no questions asked.

                                     Han
                         What is it? Some kind of local
                         trouble?

                                     BEN
                         Let's just say we'd like to avoid
                         any Imperial entanglements.

                                     Han
                         Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
                         And it's going to cost you something
                         extra. Ten thousand in advance.

                                     LUKE
                         Ten thousand? We could almost buy
                         our own ship for that!

                                     Han
                         But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

                                     LUKE
                         You bet I could. I'm not such a bad
                         pilot myself! We don't have to sit
                         here and listen...

                                     BEN
                         We haven't that much with us. But we
                         could pay you two thousand now, plus
                         fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

                                     Han
                         Seventeen, huh!

               Han ponders this for a few moments.

                                     Han
                         Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.
                         We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
                         Docking bay Ninety-four.

                                     BEN

                                     Han
                         Looks like somebody's beginning to
                         take an interest in your Handiwork.

               Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers
               looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some
               questions. The bartender points to the booth.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, we'll check it out.

               The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben
               are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

                                     Han
                         Seventeen thousand! Those guys must
                         really be desperate. This could really
                         save my neck. Get back to the ship
                         and get her ready.

                         That's okay. I'm never coming back
                         to this planet again.

               INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien
               with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature
               speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

                                     GREEDO
                         Going somewhere, Solo?

                                     Han
                         Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I
                         was just going to see your boss.
                         Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

               Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the
               gun on him.

                                     GREEDO
                         It's too late. You should have paid
                         him when you had the cHance. Jabba's
                         put a price on your head, so large
                         that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
                         will be looking for you. I'm lucky I
                         found you first.

                                     Han
                         Yeah, but this time I got the money.

                                     GREEDO
                         If you give it to me, I might forget
                         I found you.

                                     Han
                         I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

                                     GREEDO
                         Jabba's through with you. He has no
                         time for smugglers who drop their
                         shipments at the first sign of an
                         Imperial cruiser.

                                     Han
                         Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you
                         think I had a choice?

               Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

                                     GREEDO
                         You can tell that to Jabba. He may
                         only take your ship.

                                     Han
                         Over my dead body.

                                     GREEDO
                         That's the idea. I've been looking
                         forward to killing you for a long
                         time.

                                     Han
                         Yes, I'll bet you have.

               Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of
               light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as
               the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up
               and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some
               coins as he leaves.

                                     Han
                         Sorry about the mess.

               Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a
               narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking
               exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and
               robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and
               hiding from the hot winds.

                         Lock the door, Artoo.

               One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves
               on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and
               Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, check that side of the
                         street. It's secure. Move on to the
                         next door.

               The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

               Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot,
               talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder
               dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass
               by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

                         Since the XP-38 came out, they're
                         just not in demand.

                                     BEN
                         It will be enough.

               Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty
               alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like
               creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his
               faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature
               moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as
               they disappear down another alley.

                                     BEN
                         If the ship's as fast as he's
                         boasting, we ought to do well.

               INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

               Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple
               creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is
               the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is
               a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is
               a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and
               a huge ugly mouth.

                                     JABBA
                         Come on out, Solo!

               A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and
               they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee,
               Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                                     Han
                         I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

                                     JABBA
                         I expected you would be.

                                     Han
                         I'm not the type to run.

                                     JABBA
                              (fatherly-smooth)
                         Han, my boy, there are times when
                         you disappoint me... why haven't you
                         paid me? And why did you have to fry
                         poor Greedo like that... after all
                         we've been through together.

                                     Han
                         You sent Greedo to blast me.

                                     JABBA
                              (mock surprise)
                         Han, why you're the best smuggler in
                         the business. You're too valuable to
                         fry. He was only relaying my concern
                         at your delays. He wasn't going to
                         blast you.

                                     Han
                         I think he thought he was. Next time
                         don't send one of those twerps. If
                         you've got something to say to me,
                         come see me yourself.

                                     JABBA
                         Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to
                         dump that shipment of spice... you
                         understand I just can't make an
                         exception. Where would I be if every
                         pilot who smuggled for me dumped
                         their shipment at the first sign of
                         an Imperial starship? It's not good
                         business.

                                     Han
                         You know, even I get boarded
                         sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice,
                         but I've got a charter now and I can
                         pay you back, plus a little extra. I
                         just need some more time.

                                     JABBA
                              (to his men)
                         Put your blasters away. Han, my boy,
                         I'm only doing this because you're
                         the best and I need you. So, for an
                         extra, say twenty percent I'll give
                         you a little more time... but this
                         is it. If you disappoint me again,
                         I'll put a price on your head so
                         large you won't be able to go near a
                         civilized system for the rest of
                         your short life.

                                     Han
                         Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my
                         pleasure.

               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

               Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay
               94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.
               Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.
               The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder
               lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small
               transmitter.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is
               Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a
               large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that
               could only loosely be called a starship.

                                     LUKE
                         What a piece of junk.

               The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                                     Han
                         She'll make point five beyond the
                         speed of light. She may not look
                         like much, but she's got it where it
                         counts, kid. I've added some special
                         modifications myself.

               Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about
               all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others
               to follow.

                                     Han
                         We're a little rushed, so if you'll
                         hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

               The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
               Solo.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty
               engines of the starship.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium
               Falcon passing Solo.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hello, sir.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad
               creature.

                                     TROOPER
                         Which way?

               The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking
               bay.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, men. Load your weapons!

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]

               The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the
               docking bay entrance.

                                     TROOPER
                         Stop that ship!

               Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing
               into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as
               he ducks into the spaceship.

                                     TROOPER
                         Blast 'em!

               Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots
               which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The
               pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that
               slams the overhead entry shut.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

                                     Han
                         Chewie, get us out of here!

               The group straps in for take off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I
                         hate space travel.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general
               alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above
               the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the
               morning sky.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who
               chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.
               Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway,
               makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                                     Han
                         It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
                         Our passengers must be hotter tHan I
                         thought. Try and hold them off. Angle
                         the deflector shield while I make
                         the calculations for the jump to
                         light speed.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow
               planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial
               stardestroyers.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy
               spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the
               cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

                                     Han
                         Stay sharp! There are two more coming
                         in; they're going to try to cut us
                         off.

                                     LUKE
                         Why don't you outrun them? I thought
                         you said this thing was fast.

                                     Han
                         Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
                         going to find yourself floating home.
                         We'll be safe enough once we make
                         the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I
                         know a few maneuvers. We'll lose
                         them!

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

                                     Han
                         Here's where the fun begins!

                                     BEN
                         How long before you can make the
                         jump to light speed?

                                     Han
                         It'll take a few moments to get the
                         coordinates from the navi-computer.

               The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you kidding? At the rate they're
                         gaining...

                                     Han
                         Traveling through hyperspace isn't
                         like dusting crops, boy! Without
                         precise calculations we could fly
                         right through a star or bounce too
                         close to a supernova and that'd end
                         your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

               The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red
               warning light begins to flash.

                                     LUKE
                         What's that flashing?

                                     Han
                         We're losing our deflector shield.
                         Go strap yourself in, I'm going to
                         make the jump to light speed.

               The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if
               crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship
               makes the jump to hyperspace.

               Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before

                         We've entered the Alderaan system.

               Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her

                         Governor Tarkin, I should have
                         expected to find you holding Vader's
                         leash. I recognized your foul stench

                         Princess Leia, before your execution
                         I would like you to be my guest at a
                         ceremony that will make this battle
                         station operational. No star system
                         will dare oppose the Emperor now.

                                     LEIA
                         The more you tighten your grip,
                         Tarkin, the more star systems will
                         slip through your fingers.

                                     TARKIN
                         Not after we demonstrate the power
                         of this station. In a way, you have
                         determined the choice of the planet
                         that'll be destroyed first. Since
                         you are reluctant to provide us with
                         the location of the Rebel base, I
                         have chosen to test this station's
                         destructive power... on your home
                         planet of Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                         No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no
                         weapons. You can't possibly...

                                     TARKIN
                         You would prefer another target? A
                         military target? Then name the system!

               Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

                                     TARKIN
                         I grow tired of asking this. So it'll
                         be the last time. Where is the Rebel
                         base?

               Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to
               Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                              (softly)
                         Dantooine.

               Leia lowers her head.

                                     LEIA
                         They're on Dantooine.

                                     TARKIN
                         There. You see Lord Vader, she can
                         be reasonable.
                              (addressing Motti)
                         Continue with the operation. You may
                         fire when ready.

                                     LEIA
                         What?

                                     TARKIN
                         You're far too trusting. Dantooine
                         is too remote to make an effective
                         demonstration. But don't worry. We
                         will deal with your Rebel friends
                         soon enough.

                                     LEIA
                         No!

               INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

                                     VADER
                         Commence primary ignition.

               A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A
               hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.
               Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another
               lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A
               huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area
               and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.
               The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker"
               robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,
               seems almost faint.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you all right? What's wrong?

                                     BEN
                         I felt a great disturbance in the
                         Force... as if millions of voices
                         suddenly cried out in terror and
                         were suddenly silenced. I fear
                         something terrible has happened.

               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then
               he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                                     BEN
                         You'd better get on with your
                         exercises.

               Han Solo enters the room.

                                     Han
                         Well, you can forget your troubles
                         with those Imperial slugs. I told
                         you I'd outrun 'em.

               Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                                     Han
                         Don't everyone tHank me at once.

               Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
               game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move
               along a chess-type board.

                                     Han
                         Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
                         about oh-two-hundred hours.

               Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table
               covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the
               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca
               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-
               covered arms over his head.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Now be careful, Artoo.

               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his
               stubby claw Hand, causing one of the holographic creatures
               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's
               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.
               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and
               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He made a fair move. Screaming about
                         it won't help you.

                                     Han
                              (interrupting)
                         Let him have it. It's not wise to
                         upset a Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         But sir, nobody worries about
                         upsetting a droid.

                                     Han
                         That's 'cause droids don't pull
                         people's arms out of their socket
                         when they lose. Wookiees are known
                         to do that.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see your point, sir. I suggest a
                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee
                         win.

               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems
               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his
               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
               Han watches with a bit of smugness.

                                     BEN
                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
                         flowing through him.

                                     LUKE
                         You mean it controls your actions?

                                     BEN
                         Partially. But it also obeys your
                         commands.

               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a
               "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,
               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of
               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift
               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke face. Luke doesn't
               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,
               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood
               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing
               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

                                     Han
                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons
                         are no match for a good blaster at
                         your side, kid.

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe in the Force, do
                         you?

                                     Han
                         Kid, I've flown from one side of
                         this galaxy to the other. I've seen
                         a lot of strange stuff, but I've
                         never seen anything to make me believe
                         there's one all-powerful force
                         controlling everything. There's no
                         mystical energy field that controls
                         my destiny.

               Ben smiles quietly.

                                     Han
                         It's all a lot of simple tricks and
                         nonsense.

                                     BEN
                         I suggest you try it again, Luke.

               Ben places a large helmet on Luke head which covers his
               eyes.

                                     BEN
                         This time, let go your conscious
                         self and act on instinct.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         With the blast shield down, I can't
                         even see. How am I supposed to fight?

                                     BEN
                         Your eyes can deceive you. Don't
                         trust them.

               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker
               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then
               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly
               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits
               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful
               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

                                     BEN
                         Stretch out with your feelings.

               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes
               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the
               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original
               position.

                                     BEN
                         You see, you can do it.

                                     Han
                         I call it luck.

                                     BEN
                         In my experience, there's no such
                         thing as luck.

                                     Han
                         Look, going good against remotes is
                         one thing. Going good against the
                         living? That's something else.

               Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the
               control panel.

                                     Han
                         Looks like we're coming up on
                         Alderaan.

               Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, I did feel something. I
                         could almost see the remote.

                                     BEN
                         That's good. You have taken your
                         first step into a larger world.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the
               evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

                                     OFFICER CASS
                         Our scout ships have reached
                         Dantooine. They found the remains of
                         a Rebel base, but they estimate that
                         it has been deserted for some time.
                         They are now conducting an extensive
                         search of the surrounding systems.

                                     TARKIN
                         She lied! She lied to us!

                                     VADER
                         I told you she would never consciously
                         betray the Rebellion.

                                     TARKIN
                         Terminate her... immediately!

               EXT. HYPERSPACE

               The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange
               surreal light show surrounds the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                                     Han
                         Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in
                         the sublight engines.

               Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window
               stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then
               stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently
               shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering
               the sides of the ship.

                                     Han
                         What the...? Aw, we've come out of
                         hyperspace into a meteor shower.
                         Some kind of asteroid collision.
                         It's not on any of the charts.

               The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool
               in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing
               cockpit.

                         What's going on?

                         Our position is correct, except...
                         no, Alderaan!

                         Thats what I'm trying to tell you,
                         kid. It ain't there. It's been totally
                         blown away.

                         What? How?

               Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to
               settle down.

                                     BEN
                         Destroyed... by the Empire!

                         The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
                         the whole planet. It'd take a thousand

               A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled
               alarm starts humming.

                                     Han
                         There's another ship coming in.

                                     LUKE
                         Maybe they know what happened.

                                     BEN
                         It's an Imperial fighter.

               Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside
               the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned
               Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         It followed us!

                         No. It's a short range fighter.

                                     Han
                         There aren't any bases around here.
                         Where did it come from?

               The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.

                         It'd be as well to let it go. It's
                         too far out of range.

               The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the
               vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny
               fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter
               until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben
               stands behind Chewbacca.

                         this deep into space on its own.

               The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as
               they race toward camera and disappear over head.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or
               planet.

                         Look at him. He's headed for that
                         small moon.

                         there... he's almost in range.

               The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous
               spherical battle station.

                         It's too big to be a space station.

                         power.

               The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away
               toward the gargantuan battle station.

               Ben Kenobi puts a Hand on his shoulder.

               metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station
               becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic

               The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound

               In a very small command office near the entrance to the
               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices
               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER

               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and
               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating
               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his
               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an
               annoyed look.

                         transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing
               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary
               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling
               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.
               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted
               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the
               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed
               as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, between his howling and
                         your blasting everything in sight,
                         it's a wonder the whole station
                         doesn't know we're here.

                                     Han
                         Bring them on! I prefer a straight
                         fight to all this sneaking around.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We found the computer outlet, sir.

               Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of
               the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it
               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

                                     BEN
                         Plug in. He should be able to
                         interpret the entire Imperial computer
                         network.

               Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the
               vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information
               to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's found the main computer
                         to power the tractor beam that's
                         holding the ship here. He'll try to
                         make the precise location appear on
                         the monitor.

               The computer monitor flashes readouts.

                                     THREEPIO
                         The tractor beam is coupled to the
                         main reactor in seven locations. A
                         power loss at one of the terminals
                         will allow the ship to leave.

               Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

                                     BEN
                         I don't think you boys can help. I
                         must go alone.

                                     Han
                         Whatever you say. I've done more
                         that I bargained for on this trip
                         already.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to go with you.

                                     BEN
                         Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch
                         over the droids.

                                     LUKE
                         But he can...

                                     BEN
                         They must be delivered safely or
                         other star systems will suffer the
                         same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny
                         lies along a different path tHan
                         mine. The Force will be with you...
                         always!

               Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps
               out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey
               hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head
               in agreement.

                                     Han
                         Boy you said it, Chewie.

               Han looks at Luke.

                                     Han
                         Where did you dig up that old fossil?

                                     LUKE
                         Ben is a great man.

                                     Han
                         Yeah, great at getting us into
                         trouble.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't hear you give any ideas...

                                     Han
                         Well, anything would be better tHan
                         just Hanging around waiting for him
                         to pick us up...

                                     LUKE
                         Who do you think...

               Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
               Luke goes over to him.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
                         He says "I found her", and keeps
                         repeating, "She's here."

                                     LUKE
                         Well, who... who has he found?

               Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Princess Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         The princess? She's here?

                                     Han
                         Princess? What's going on?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
                         three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to
                         be terminated.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no! We've got to do something.

                                     Han
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         The droid belongs to her. She's the
                         one in the message... We've got to
                         help her.

                                     Han
                         Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
                         The old man wants us to wait right
                         here.

                                     LUKE
                         But he didn't know she was here.
                         Look, will you just find a way back
                         into the detention block?

                                     Han
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     LUKE
                         They're going to execute her. Look,
                         a few minutes ago you said you didn't
                         want to just wait here to be captured.
                         Now all you want to do is stay.

                                     Han
                         Marching into the detention area is
                         not what I had in mind.

                                     LUKE
                         But they're going to kill her!

                                     Han
                         Better her tHan me...

                                     LUKE
                         She's rich.

               Chewbacca growls.

                                     Han
                         Rich?

                                     LUKE
                         Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you
                         were to rescue her, the reward would
                         be...

                                     Han
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Well more wealth that you can imagine.

                                     Han
                         I don't know, I can imagine quite a
                         bit!

                                     LUKE
                         You'll get it!

                                     Han
                         I better!

                                     LUKE
                         You will...

                                     Han
                         All right, kid. But you'd better be
                         right about this.

               Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                                     LUKE
                         All right.

                                     Han
                         What's your plan?

                                     LUKE
                         Uh... Threepio, Hand me those binders
                         there will you?

               Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on
                         you.

               Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Han, you put these on.

               Luke sheepishly Hands the binders to Han.

                                     Han
                         Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know
                         what he has in mind.

               The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as
               Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for
                         asking... but, ah... what should
                         Artoo and I do if we're discovered
                         here?

                                     LUKE
                         Lock the door!

                                     Han
                         And hope they don't have blasters.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That isn't very reassuring.

               Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and
               start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits
               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,
               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio
               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious
               glance.

               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.

               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away
               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and
               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main
               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot
               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end
               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then
               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting
               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.
               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY
               AREA

               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door
               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards
               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates
               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

                                     Han
                         This is not going to work.

                                     LUKE
                         Why didn't you say so before?

                                     Han
                         I did say so before!

               INT. DETENTION AREA

               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches
               the trio.

                                     OFFICER
                         Where are you taking this... thing?

               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut
               up.

                                     LUKE
                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                         three-eight.

                                     OFFICER
                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear
                         it.

               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in
               the information. There are only three other troopers in the
               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the
               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of
               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his Hands and lets out with one
               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

                                     Han
                         Look out! He's loose!

                                     LUKE
                         He's going to pull us all apart.

                                     Han
                         Go get him!

               The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and
               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are
               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of
               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser
               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the
               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is
               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink
               system, which is screeching questions about what is going
               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

                                     Han
                         We've got to find out which cell
                         this princess of yours is in. Here
                         it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
                         You go get her. I'll hold them here.

               Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into
               the buzzing comlink.

                                     Han
                              (sounding official)
                         Everything is under control. Situation
                         normal.

                         leak here now. Give us a few minutes
                         to lock it down. Large leak... very

               Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

                                     Han
                         Boring conversation anyway.
                              (yelling down the
                              hall)
                         Luke! We're going to have company!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW

               Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door
               away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees
               the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping
               and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on
               her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands
               staring at her with his mouth Hanging open.

                                     LEIA

                         Aren't you a little short to be a
                         stormtrooper?

               Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                                     LUKE
                         What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke

                         your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben

                         Come on!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the
               far end of the conference table.

                                     VADER
                         He is here...

                         Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think
                         so?

                                     VADER
                         A tremor in the Force. The last time
                         I felt it was in the presence of my
                         old master.

                                     TARKIN
                         Surely he must be dead by now.

                                     VADER
                         Don't underestimate the power of the
                         Force.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Jedi are extinct, their fire has
                         gone out of the universe. You, my
                         friend, are all that's left of their
                         religion.

               There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

                         If you're right, he must not be
                         allowed to escape.

                         Escape is not his plan. I must face
                         him alone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY

               An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the
               elevator door.

                                     Han
                         Chewie!

               Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

                                     Han
                         Get behind me! Get behind me!

               A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door
               through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

               Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke
               and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting
               up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                                     Han
                         Can't get out that way.

                                     LEIA
                         Looks like you managed to cut off
                         our only escape route.

                                     Han
                              (sarcastically)
                         Maybe you'd like it back in your
                         cell, Your Highness.

               Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they
               continue to excHange fire with stormtroopers making their
               way down the corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

                                     THREEPIO
                              (over comlink)
                         Yes sir?

                                     LUKE
                         We've been cut off! Are there any
                         other ways out of the cell bay?...
                         What was that? I didn't copy!

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER

               Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and
               whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink
               transmitter.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I said, all systems have been alerted
                         to your presence, sir. The main
                         entrance seems to be the only way in
                         or out; all other information on
                         your level is restricted.

               Someone begins banging on the door.

                                     TROOPER VOICE
                         Open up in there!

                         Oh, no!

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as
               they continue to excHange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca
               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far
               and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke
               fills the narrow cell corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         There isn't any other way out.

                                     Han
                         I can't hold them off forever! Now
                         what?

                                     LEIA
                         This is some rescue. When you came
                         in here, didn't you have a plan for
                         getting out?

                                     Han
                              (pointing to Luke)
                         He's the brains, sweetheart.

               Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I didn't...

               The princess grabs Luke gun and fires at a small grate in
               the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

                                     Han
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     LEIA
                         Somebody has to save our skins. Into
                         the garbage chute, wise guy.

               She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca
               look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and
               says something.

                                     Han
                         Get in there you big furry oaf! I
                         don't care what you smell! Get in
                         there and don't worry about it.

               Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the
               tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their
               way toward the opening.

                                     Han
                         Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to
                         kill her or I'm beginning to like
                         her. Get in there!

               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires
               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then
               slides into the chute himself and is gone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.
               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He
               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't
               budge.

                                     Han
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh! The garbage chute was a really
                         wonderful idea. What an incredible
                         smell you've discovered! Let's get
                         out of here! Get away from there...

                                     LUKE
                         No! wait!

               Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The
               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.
               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes
               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a
               rather grim look on her face.

                                     LUKE
                         Will you forget it? I already tried
                         it. It's magnetically sealed!

                                     LEIA
                         Put that thing away! You're going to
                         get us all killed.

                                     Han
                         Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I
                         had everything under control until
                         you led us down here. You know, it's
                         not going to take them long to figure
                         out what happened to us.

                         It could be worse...

               A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the
               murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins
               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols
               drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

                                     Han
                         It's worse.

                                     LUKE
                         There's something alive in here!

                                     Han
                         That's your imagination.

                                     LUKE
                         Something just moves past my leg!
                         Look! Did you see that?

                                     Han
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Help!

               Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

                                     Han
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air
               and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around
               his throat.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke!

               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

                                     LUKE
                         Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

                                     Han
                         Where?

                                     LUKE
                         Anywhere! Oh!!

               Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the
               muck by the slimy tentacle.

                                     Han
                         Luke! Luke!

               Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and
               move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.
               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca
               howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke
               suddenly bobs to the surface.

                                     LEIA
                         Grab him!

               Luke seems to be released by the thing.

                                     LEIA
                         What happened?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know, it just let go of me
                         and disappeared...

                                     Han
                         I've got a very bad feeling about
                         this.

               Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and
               edge toward the Rebels.

                                     LUKE
                         The walls are moving!

                                     LEIA
                         Don't just stand there. Try to brace
                         it with something.

               They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
               walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant
               trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

                                     LUKE
                         Wait a minute!

               Luke pulls out his comlink.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!
                         Where could he be?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

               A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for
               See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's Hand comlink, which
               is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and
               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great
               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the
               floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Take over!
                              (pointing to the dead
                              officer)
                         See to him! Look there!

               A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides
               open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows
               his bronze companion out into the office.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're madmen! They're heading for
                         the prison level. If you hurry, you
                         might catch them.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (to his troops)
                         Follow me! You stand guard.

               The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to
               watch over the command office.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Come on!

               The guard aims a blaster at them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh! All this excitement has overrun
                         the circuits of my counterpart here.
                         If you don't mind, I'd like to take
                         him down to maintenance.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right.

               The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries
               out the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.
               Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his
               giant paws.

               Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is
               snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

               Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.
               Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                                     Han
                         Get to the top!

                                     LEIA
                         I can't

                                     LUKE
                         Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio,
                         will you come in?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     THREEPIO
                         They aren't here! Something must
                         have happened to them. See if they've
                         been captured.

               Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall
               socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from
               the tiny robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hurry!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against
               the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each
               other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's Hand and she holds
               it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels
               the first crushing pressure against her body.

                                     Han
                         One thing's for sure. We're all going
                         to be a lot thinner!
                              (to Leia)
                         Get on top of it!

                                     LEIA
                         I'm trying!

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         THank goodness, they haven't found
                         them! Where could they be?

               Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I
                         turned it off!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his
               head above the rising ooze. Luke comlink begins to buzz
               and he rips it off his belt.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

               Muffled sounds of Luke voice over the comlink can be heard,
               but not distinctly.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Are you there, sir?

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

                                     LUKE

                         We've had some problems...

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Will you shut up and listen to me?
                         Shut down all garbage mashers on the
                         detention level, will you? Do you
                         copy?

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

                                     LUKE
                         Shut down all the garbage mashers on
                         the detention level.

                         Shut down all the garbage mashers on
                         the detention level.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

               Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible
               screaming and hollering from Luke comlink.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!
                         Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast
                         enough. It's all my fault! My poor
                         master!

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Threepio, we're all right!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.
               The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace
               in the background.

                                     LUKE
                         We're all right. You did great.

               Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a
               number.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey... hey, open the pressure
                         maintenance hatch on unit number...

               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

               Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge
               tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.
               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.
               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading
               to a control panel that connects two large cables. He
               carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal,
               and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

               The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.
               Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster
               belts.

                                     Han
                         If we can just avoid any more female
                         advice, we ought to be able to get
                         out of here.

               Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster
               from Solo.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, let's get moving!

               Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage
               room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

                                     Han
                              (to Chewie)
                         Where are you going?

               The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy
               tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a
               victim. Han aims his pistol.

                                     LEIA
                         No, wait. They'll hear!

               Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes
               relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply
               shakes his head in disgust.

                                     Han
                              (to Chewie)
                         Come here, you big coward!

               Chewie shakes his head "no."

                                     Han
                         Chewie! Come here!

                                     LEIA
                         Listen. I don't know who you are, or
                         where you came from, but from now
                         on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

               Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

                                     Han
                         Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get
                         one thing straight! I take orders
                         from one person! Me!

                                     LEIA
                         It's a wonder you're still alive.
                              (looking at Chewie)
                         Will somebody get this big walking
                         carpet out of my way?

               Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

                                     Han
                         No reward is worth this.

               They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

               Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of
               stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly
               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few
               feet of him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Secure this area until the alert is
                         canceled.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Give me regular reports.

               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Do you know what's going on?

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Maybe it's another drill.

               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers
               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his Hand
               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the
               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips
               past the troopers and into the main hallway.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         What was that?

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about
                         it.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and
               stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers
               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

                                     Han
                              (looking at his ship)
                         There she is.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio, do you copy?

                                     THREEPIO
                              (voice)
                         For the moment. Uh, we're in the
                         main Hangar across from the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         We're right above you. Stand by.

               Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of
               the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and
               points out the window to the ship.

                                     LEIA
                         You came in that thing? You're braver
                         that I thought.

                                     Han
                         Nice! Come on!

               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the
               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty
               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are
               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         It's them! Blast them!

               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges
               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the
               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down
               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

                                     Han
                              (to Luke and Leia)
                         Get back to the ship!

                                     LUKE
                         Where are you going? Come back!

               Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

                                     LEIA
                         He certainly has courage.

                                     LUKE
                         What good will it do us if he gets
                         himself killed? Come on!

               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for
               muted alarms begin to go off down on the Hangar deck. Luke
               and Leia start off toward the starship Hangar.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is
               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a
               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few
               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops
               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are
               moving into an attack position in front of the lone
               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops
               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt
               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of
               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate
               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of
               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running
               the other way also.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down
               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They
               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an
               open hatchway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge
               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.
               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft,
               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance
               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of
               his arm and pulls him back.

                                     LUKE
                              (gasping)
                         I think we took a wrong turn.

               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby
               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at
               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch
               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving
               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overHang.
               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

                                     LEIA
                         There's no lock!

               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

                                     LUKE
                         That oughta hold it for a while.

                                     LEIA
                         Quick, we've got to get across. Find
                         the control that extends the bridge.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, I think I just blasted it.

               Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the
               stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making
               ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

                                     LEIA
                         They're coming through!

               Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when
               laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol
               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overHang across
               the abyss from them. They excHange fire. Two more troops
               appear on another overHang, also firing. A trooper is hit,
               and grabs at his chest.

               Another trooper standing on the bridge overHang is hit by
               Luke laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move
               back off the bridge; Luke Hands the gun to Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         Here, hold this.

               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.
               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge
               overHang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the
               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears
               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.
               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet
               of more troops.

                                     LEIA
                         Here they come!

               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and
               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the
               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He
               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the
               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him
               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

                                     LEIA
                         For luck!

               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss
               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as
               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the
               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at
               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into
               the tiny subhallway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several
               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks
               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the
               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of
               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the
               pirateship entry ramp.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where could they be?

               Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left
               and right, beeping a response.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several
               troopers hot on their trail.

                                     TROOPER
                         Close the blast doors!

               At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in
               front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion
               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage
               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops
               before the doors slam shut.

                                     TROOPER
                         Open the blast doors! Open the blast
                         doors!

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the Hangar
               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the Hangar,
               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not
               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his
               and steps slowly forward.

                                     VADER
                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
                         We meet again, at last. The circle
                         is now complete.

               Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive
               position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

                                     VADER
                         When I left you, I was but the
                         learner; now I am the master.

                                     BEN
                         Only a master of evil, Darth.

               The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few
               moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right
               moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,
               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He
               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked
               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke
               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's
               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark
               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship Hangar.
               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments
               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing
               sound.

                                     VADER
                         Your powers are weak, old man.

                                     BEN
                         You can't win, Darth. If you strike
                         me down, I shall become more powerful
                         tHan you can possibly imagine.

               Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in Hand, lean back
               against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the
               Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the Hangar.

                                     Han
                         Didn't we just leave this party?

               Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

                                     Han
                         What kept you?

                                     LEIA
                         We ran into some old friends.

                                     LUKE
                         Is the ship all right?

                                     Han
                         Seems okay, if we can get to it.
                         Just hope the old man got the tractor
                         beam out of commission.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they
               hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.
               Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord
               of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his
               group's vantage point.

                                     LUKE
                         Look!

               Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader
               emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking
               bay.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's
               Imperial docking bay.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come on, Artoo, we're going!

               Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who
               were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards
               Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The
               troops rush toward the battling knights.

                                     Han
                         Now's our cHance! Go!

               They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops
               charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader
               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings
               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to
               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts
               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene
               look on his face.

               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's
               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.
               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the
               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers
               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two
               and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
               The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium
               Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns
               their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and
               advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

                                     Han
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on!

                                     LEIA
                         Come on! Luke, its too late!

                                     Han
                         Blast the door! Kid!

               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it
               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge
               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close
               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the
               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his
               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,
               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He
               fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Run, Luke! Run!

               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns
               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the
               troopers and races into the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.
               The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the
               ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

                                     Han
                         I hope the old man got that tractor
                         beam out if commission, or this is
                         going to be a real short trip. Okay,
                         hit it!

               Chewbacca growls in agreement.

               EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking
               bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness
               of space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off
               blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around
               him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She
               sits down beside him.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

                                     Han
                              (to Chewie)
                         We're coming up on the sentry ships.
                         Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector
                         shields while I charge up the main
                         guns!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth,
               as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't believe he's gone.

               Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

                                     LEIA
                         There wasn't anything you could have
                         done.

               Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the
               princess.

                                     Han
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on, buddy, we're not out of
                         this yet!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

               Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

               Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads
               for the cockpit.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

               Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling
               into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large
               rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT

               Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of
               his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

                                     Han
                              (to Luke)
                         You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

               Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking
               TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls
               as the ship bounces slightly.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT - COCKPIT

               Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as

               The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon,
               one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.

               The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts
               his maneuvering joy stick.

               The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as
               it passes.

               Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo.
               The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in
               the room and then comes back on.

               A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and
               fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as
               the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor
               hit, and bounces slightly.

               A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The
               ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet
               fill of small computer chips.

                                     THREEPIO

                         Don't worry, she'll hold together.

               An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,
               causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

                                     Han

               Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control
               panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant
               beeping all the while.

               fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He
               connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs
               victoriously.

               smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular
               direct hit.

               Luke and Han look into their respective projected target
               screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han
               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser
               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke port, and he reacts
               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his
               face.

               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc
               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the
               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon
               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower
               of burning fragments.

                         secure aboard their ship? I'm taking
                         an awful risk, Vader. This had better
                         work.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of
               the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the
               damage. Leia is seated near Han.

                                     Han
                         Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You
                         know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

                                     LEIA
                         That doesn't sound too hard. Besides,
                         they let us go. It's the only
                         explanation for the ease of our
                         escape.

                                     Han
                         Easy... you call that easy?

                                     LEIA
                         Their tracking us!

                                     Han
                         Not this ship, sister.

               Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                                     LEIA
                         At least the information in Artoo is
                         still intact.

                                     Han
                         What's so important? What's he
                         carrying?

                                     LEIA
                         The technical readouts of that battle
                         station. I only hope that when the
                         data is analyzed, a weakness can be
                         found. It's not over yet!

                                     Han
                         It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't
                         in this for your revolution, and I'm
                         not in it for you, Princess. I expect
                         to be well paid. I'm in it for the
                         money!

                                     LEIA
                         You needn't worry about your reward.
                         If money is all that you love, then
                         that's what you'll receive!

               She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,
               passes Luke coming in.

                                     LEIA
                         Your friend is quite a mercenary. I
                         wonder if he really cares about
                         anything... or anyone.

                                     LUKE
                         I care!

               Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han
               stare out at the vast blackness of space.

                                     LUKE
                         So... what do you think of her, Han?

                                     Han
                         I'm trying not to, kid!

                                     LUKE
                              (under his breath)
                         Good...

                                     Han
                         Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I
                         don't know, what do you think? Do
                         you think a princess and a guy like
                         me...

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at
               young Luke jealousy.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet
               Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

               EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

               An alert guard, his laser gun in Hand, scans the countryside.
               He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely
               visible in the foliage.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

               Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple
               lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the
               fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the
               others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

               Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored
               military speeder.

               INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HanGAR DECK

               The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship Hangar, set
               up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the
               commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and
               gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                                     WILLARD
                              (holding Leia)
                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.

               Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

                                     WILLARD
                         When we heard about Alderaan, we
                         were afraid that you were... lost
                         along with your father.

                                     LEIA
                         We don't have time for our sorrows,
                         Commander. The battle station has
                         surely tracked us here.
                              (looking pointedly to
                              Han)
                         It's the only explanation for the
                         ease of our escape. You must use the
                         information in this R2 unit to plan
                         the attack. It is our only hope.

               EXT. SPACE

               The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red
               planet Yavin.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their
               discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer
               the call.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a
               moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

               EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

               A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,
               surveying the countryside. A mist Hangs over the jungle of
               twisted green.

               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia
               and several other senators are to one side of the giant
               readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,
               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is
               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and
               Chewbacca are standing near the back.

                                     DODONNA
                         The battle station is heavily shielded
                         and carries a firepower greater tHan
                         half the star fleet. It's defenses
                         are designed around a direct large-
                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter
                         should be able to penetrate the outer
                         defense.

               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands
               and addresses Dodonna.

                                     GOLD LEADER
                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what
                         good are snub fighters going to be
                         against that?

                                     DODONNA
                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a
                         small one-man fighter to be any
                         threat, or they'd have a tighter
                         defense. An analysis of the plans
                         provided by Princess Leia has
                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle
                         station.

               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping
               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

                                     DODONNA
                         The approach will not be easy. You
                         are required to maneuver straight
                         down this trench and skim the surface
                         to this point. The target area is
                         only two meters wide. It's a small
                         thermal exhaust port, right below
                         the main port. The shaft leads
                         directly to the reactor system. A
                         precise hit will start a chain
                         reaction which should destroy the
                         station.

               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

                                     DODONNA
                         Only a precise hit will set up a
                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton
                         torpedoes.

               Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about
               sixteen years old.

                                     WEDGE
                         That's impossible, even for a
                         computer.

                                     LUKE
                         It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
                         eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back
                         home. They're not much bigger tHan
                         two meters.

                                     DODONNA
                         Man your ships! And may the Force be
                         with you!

               The group rises and begins to leave.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the
               tiny green moon.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with
               interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another
               on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and
               the forth moon.

                         This will be a day long remembered.
                         It has seen the end of Kenobi and it
                         will soon see the end of the
                         Rebellion.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HanGAR DECK

               Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship
               Hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.
               Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and
               unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this
               activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes
               onto an armored speeder.

                                     MAN'S VOICE

                         All flight troops, man your stations.

               Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter
               pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of
               his friend's departure.

                                     LUKE
                         So... you got your reward and you're
                         just leaving then?

                                     Han
                         That's right, yeah! I got some old
                         debts I've got to pay off with this
                         stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't
                         think I'd be fool enough to stick
                         around here, do you? Why don't you
                         come with us? You're pretty good in
                         a fight. I could use you.

                                     LUKE
                              (getting angry)
                         Come on! Why don't you take a look
                         around? You know what's about to
                         happen, what they're up against.
                         They could use a good pilot like
                         you. You're turning your back on
                         them.

                                     Han
                         What good's a reward if you ain't
                         around to use it? Besides, attacking
                         that battle station ain't my idea of
                         courage. It's more like suicide.

                                     LUKE
                         All right. Well, take care of
                         yourself, Han. I guess that's what
                         you're best at, isn't it?

               Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

                                     Han
                         Hey, Luke... may the Force be with
                         you!

               Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his Hand in
               a small wave and then goes off.

               Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

                                     Han
                         What're you lookin' at? I know what
                         I'm doing.

               INT. MAIN HanGAR DECK - Luke SHIP

               Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                                     LEIA
                         What's wrong?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
                         thought he'd cHange his mind.

                                     LEIA
                         He's got to follow his own path. No
                         one can choose it for him.

                                     LUKE
                         I only wish Ben were here.

               Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
               heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
               his arm.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
                         get here... are you going out with
                         us?!

                                     LUKE
                         Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
                         with you! Listen, have I got some
                         stories to tell...

               Red Leader, a rugged Handsome man in his forties, comes up
               behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
               leader.

                                     RED LEADER
                         Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
                         been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
                         five?

                                     BIGGS
                         Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
                         the outer rim territories.

               Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
               his fighter.

                                     RED LEADER
                         I met your father once when I was
                         just a boy, he was a great pilot.
                         You'll do all right. If you've got
                         half of your father's skill, you'll
                         do better tHan all right.

                                     LUKE
                         THank you, sir. I'll try.

               Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                                     BIGGS
                         I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll
                         tell me your stories when we come
                         back. All right?

                                     LUKE
                         I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

                                     BIGGS
                              (going off)
                         You did, all right. It's going to be
                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple
                         of shooting stars that'll never be
                         stopped!

               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
               his ship.

               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points
               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the
               back of the fighter.

                                     CHIEF
                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit
                         beat up. Do you want a new one?

                                     LUKE
                         Not on your life! That little droid
                         and I have been through a lot
                         together.
                              (to Artoo)
                         You okay, Artoo?

               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
               that he is fine.

               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
               Hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
               into Luke X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo
               beeps good-bye.

                                     CHIEF
                         Okay, easy she goes!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to
                         come back.

               Artoo beeps in agreement.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You wouldn't want my life to get
                         boring, would you?

               Artoo whistles his reply.

               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
               The Hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The
               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted
               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses
               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,
               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace
               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Luke, the Force will be with you.

               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing
               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The
               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this
               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion
               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage
               in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud
               cover.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly
               before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its
               four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves
               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear
               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills
               the war room.

                                     MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE
                         Stand-by alert. Death Star

                         range, fifteen minutes.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface
               of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying
               in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

               EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

               Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow
               around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in
               formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly
               pull away.

               INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT

               Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,
               looking to each side at his wing men.

                                     RED LEADER
                         All wings report in.

               INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT

               One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.

               Biggs checks his fighter's controls, alert and ready for
               combat.

               Artoo-Detoo, in position outside of the fighter, turns his
               head from side to side and makes beeping sounds.

               The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the
               Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X"
               position.

               Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the
               approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted
               slightly.

               EXT. SPACE

               The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The
               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in
               size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the
               metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna
               is built into the surface on one side.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome
               spectacle.

               As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome
               size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half
               of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area
               sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines
               and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a
               city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

               INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

               Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming
               in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in
               the background. He moves his computer targeting device into
               position.

                                     RED LEADER
                         We're in position. I'm going to cut
                         across the axis and try and draw
                         their fire.

               Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive
               towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across
               the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-
               powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate
               the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting
               devices.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
               wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death
               Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and
               fires.

               X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous
               fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit
               window.

                                     LUKE
                         This is Red Five; I'm going in!

               EXT. SPACE

               Luke X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak
               from Luke weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on
               the dim surface.

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Terror crosses Luke face as he realizes he won't be able
               to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

                                     BIGGS
                              (over headset)
                         Luke, pull up!

               EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR

               Luke ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges
               of his wings slightly scorched.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief.
               Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface
               with laserbolts.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in
               all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.
               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and
               foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes
               up to him.

                                     ASTRO-OFFICER
                         We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord
                         Vader. But they're so small they're
                         evading our turbo-lasers!

                                     VADER
                         We'll have to destroy them ship to
                         ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their
               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes
               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head
               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming
               noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet
               with his Hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

               INT. READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

                         Luke, let me know when you're going
                         in.

               INT. Luke X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose
               down and starts his attack dive.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm on my way in now...

                         Watch yourself! There's a lot of
                         fire coming from the right side of
                         that deflection tower.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm on it.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon
               and down onto the dim grey surface.

               EXT. Luke X-WING TRAVELING

               A shot hurls from Luke guns. Laserbolts streak toward the
               onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements
               erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on
               the surface.

               INT. Luke X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window
               as a big smile sweeps across Luke face at the success of
               his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers
               his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from
               the surface towards the heavens.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout
               the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke
               and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of
               explosions.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and
               gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A
               dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small
               auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces
               nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides
               technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna
               watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working
               over a screen speaks into his headset.

                                     CONTROL OFFICER

               Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching
               Imperial fighters.

                                     LUKE
                         My scope's negative. I don't see
                         anything.

               INT. RED LEADER'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches
               the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

                                     RED LEADER
                         Keep up your visual scanning. With
                         all this jamming, they'll be on top
                         of you before your scope can pick
                         them up.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon,
               four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.
               Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan
               with the remaining two TIE ships.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The
               horizon in the background twists around as he peels off,
               hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

                         I can't see it! Where is he?!

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed
               by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several
               laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying
               to avoid him.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward
               the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE
               fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

               INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to
               normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

                                     LUKE

               Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now
               followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of
               sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

               In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the
               Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the

               Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the
               surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep
               trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as
               laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

               INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered
               helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He
               looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is
               buffeted by Imperial flak.

               INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

               Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the
               exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing
               numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to
               bounce about.

                         the surface, some on the towers.

               Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target
               screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target
               near the center blinks on and off.

               Gold Two, a younger pilot about Luke age, pulls down his
               targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under
               intense laser barrage.

                         Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

               As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly
               all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench
               as the surface whips past in a blur.

                                     GOLD TWO

               Princess Leia returns her general's worried and doubtful
               glances with solid, grim determination. Threepio seems
               nervous.

                                     THREEPIO

               Luke lines up the yellow cross-hair lines of the targeting
               device's screen. He looks into the targeting device, then
               starts at a voice he hears.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Use the Force, Luke.

               Luke looks up, then starts to look back into the targeting
               device. He has second thoughts.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Let go, Luke.

               A grim determination sweeps across Luke face as he closes
               his eyes and starts to mumble Ben's training to himself.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke fighter streaks through the trench.

               Vader follows Luke X-wing down the trench.

               INT. Luke X-WING - COCKPIT

               Luke looks to the targeting device, then away as he hears
               Ben's voice.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Luke, trust me.

               Luke Hand reaches for the control panel and presses the
               button. The targeting device moves away.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

                         off your targeting computer. What's
                         wrong?

               The three TIE fighters, manned by Vader and his two wingmen,
               follow Luke X-wing down the trench.

               INT. DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT

               Vader maneuvers his controls as he looks at his doomed target.
               He presses the fire buttons on his control sticks. Laserfire
               shoots toward Luke X-wing fighter.

               EXT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER

               A large burst of Vader's laserfire engulfs Artoo. The arms
               go limp on the smoking little droid as he makes a high-pitched
               sound.

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke looks frantically back over his shoulder at Artoo.

               Smoke billows out around little Artoo and sparks begin to
               fly.

               The three TIE fighters zoom down the Death Star trench in
               pursuit of Luke, never breaking formation.

               Vader's targeting computer swings around into position. Vader
               takes careful aim on Luke X-wing fighter.

               He pushes the fire buttons.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               The three TIE fighters move in on Luke. As Vader's center
               fighter unleashes a volley of laserfire, one of the TIE ships
               at his side is hit and explodes into flame. The two remaining
               ships continue to move in.

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Vader is taken by surprise, and looks out from his cockpit.

               It's a collision course.

               INT. WINGMAN'S COCKPIT

               The wingman spots the pirateship coming at him and warns the
               Dark Lord.

                                     WINGMAN
                         Look out!

               EXT. DEATH STAR TRENCH

               Vader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate
               starship and veers radically to one side, colliding with
               Vader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes
               into the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged
               ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Vader's ship spins out of control with a bent solar fin,
               heading for deep space.

               Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust
               port, then fires his laser torpedoes.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply
               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do
               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are
               heading for the main reactor.

               INT. Luke X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like
               Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small

               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a

               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting.
               Princess Leia rushes toward him.

                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance
               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace
               one another, slapping each other on the back.

                                     Han

                         the credit and take all the reward.

               Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves
               at Luke face. Leia moves in between them.

                                     LEIA

               The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the
               fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
